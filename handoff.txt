PROJECT: ADA (Audio Documentation Assistant)

You are working on the ADA web application.
This repository contains the FULL source code.

CURRENT BASELINE
- Latest stable version: ADA v6.17.8
- This version fixes a critical bug where app-recording.js was not executed
  (SyntaxError caused some buttons to not work on the "Visita" page).
- This repository already includes the fixed app-recording.js.

MANDATORY RULES
1. RELEASE NOTES
   - There must be ONLY ONE release notes file: RELEASE_NOTES.md
   - It is cumulative.
   - Each new version must be added as a new section (## vX.Y.Z).
   - NEVER create separate release note files.

2. VISITA PAGE – REQUIRED WORKING BUTTONS
   The following buttons MUST work at all times:
   - 🎤 Microphone (toggleRecording)
   - 📁 Carica audio
   - 🧪 Carica audio lungo (test chunking)
   - 🧪 Carica testo lungo (test append)
   - 📄 Carica testo
   If any of these do not work, it is a blocking bug.

3. SCRIPT LOADING
   - app-recording.js MUST load without syntax errors.
   - If app-recording.js fails, most Visita buttons will not work.
   - Always verify that functions like:
     toggleRecording,
     triggerAudioUpload,
     triggerLongAudioTestUpload,
     triggerLongTextTestUpload
     exist and are callable.

4. LONG AUDIO HANDLING
   - OpenAI API upload limit is 25MB per request.
   - NEVER slice WebM/MP4 audio by raw bytes.
   - For long audio (>25MB), use time-based chunking on decoded audio
     (e.g. WAV / PCM mono 16kHz).
   - Avoid corrupted container uploads.

5. DEBUG MODE
   - When "Debug attivo (per i test)" is enabled:
     - ADA.log must be verbose.
     - Debug/test-only features must be visible.
     - Errors must be logged clearly.

WHAT TO DO FIRST
- Read AGENTS.md
- Read RELEASE_NOTES.md
- Verify Visita page buttons manually.
- Report any script load errors immediately.
